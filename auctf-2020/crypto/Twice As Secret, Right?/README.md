The chall alone gives us a mysterious wav file.
Opening it with a tool like Sonic Visualiser to view audio files.

If we zoom it, we immediately notice that the file is composed of an alternation of longer and shorter sounds.

So easy to think it's a Morse code.
Being a long audio, just use any automatic online tool for decoding Morse code.
Decoding gives us a long string of only A and B:

BABAAAABAAABABAABABAAABBBAAAAABAABBAABAABAABAABBABABABBAABAAAABAABAABAAAAAAABBAAABBABBAABAAABBBAABAABAAAAAAABBAAAAABABBABABAAAABAABAAAAAABAAAABAABABABABBBAAABAAAAABABAABAABAAAABBAAAABBABAABAAABBBAABAAABABBBAABAABBABAAABAABBABABABBAABAAAABBBAABAABAAAAAABAABAAABABBABABBABABBAABAABAAABBBAABAAABABBAABAABAAABBAAABAAAAAAABBAAABAAAABBBAAAAABAAABBAABAABBABAAAABAABAAAAABBAABAAABABAABAAABAABBAABAABAAAAAABAAAAABBBAAABABBABABBABABBAAABBABBAABAAABBBAABAABAAAABABAAABAAABAAABAABAAAAAAAABABAABABAABAAABAAABAABABABBABBAAAAABBAAAAAAABAABBAABBAAABBBBAABABAABAAABBBAABAAAABABABABAAAAAAAABBAABAAABAAABAAAAABAABBAAABABAABAAABABBAAABABBABABABBAABAAABBABABBAAAABAAABBAAAABAAAABAAAAABBBAAABBAABAABBABAAABAAAAAAABABAABABABAABAAABBBAABAAAABABAAABAAAABAABBABABBAABAABAAABBBAABAABAAABAABAAAAABABAAAAAAAAABABBBBABBAAABABAAAAABAAAAABABBAABAABAAAABAAAB

The cipher used is therefore Bacon's cipher and using it to decipher the string we have the flag:
