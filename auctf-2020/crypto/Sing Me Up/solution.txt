The challenge gives us the values (n, e) and a ciphertext composed of an array of integers.
(n, e) is clearly a public RSA key.
n is too large to factor in an acceptable time so we have to change our strategy.
We have to solve the equation m = c ** d % n and presumably every integer in the array is a character of the flag, 
which therefore must be printable.
In the equation we only need the value of m but we know it must be a printable character, 
so we have a small range of possibilities to try until the equation is correct.
So that's the character of the flag.
