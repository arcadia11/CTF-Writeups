The chall gave ciphertext an array of integers and the values (n, e) = (627585038806247, 65537).
This is clearly a public key of RSA and it is noted that the module n is particularly short, 
therefore it can most likely be factored in a short time.
So with the factors p and q it is possible to calculate phi and therefore d.
Finally, only a simple equation remains to be calculated:
m = c ** d% n
